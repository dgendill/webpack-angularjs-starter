# webpack AngularJS Starter

A basic starter package for a new AngularJS project. Code is grouped in module folders as opposed to controller/service/directive folders. Mocha tests for the module should be placed in the corresponding `test/modules/[name].test.js` file.

# Install and Usage

```
npm install
npm run dev
```

Visit http://localhost:8080/ afterwords. View the console to see which tests failed or passed.
